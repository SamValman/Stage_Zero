            <p>This is currently a placeholder website to provide a brief description of what Stage Zero is, how it has been developed, and to start collating links for available resources. A more extensive description of Stage Zero, completed projects, and planned restoration works will be included in the website under development. If you are a practitioner or researcher in this field and have resources or wish to be identified on this final webpage please email samuel.valman@nottingham.ac.uk. </p>
