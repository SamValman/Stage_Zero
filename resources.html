            <p>This is currently a placeholder website to provide a brief description of what Stage Zero is, how it has been developed, and to start collating links for available resources. A more extensive description of Stage Zero, completed projects, and planned restoration works will be included in the website under development.

          readings and websites. It is recommended that the Webinars are one of the first places to go
          to hear some of the instructors of this course give overviews of Stage Zero.
