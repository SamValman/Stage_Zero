          <h2>Defining Stage Zero</h2>
            <p>
              Stage Zero is the initial, pre-disturbance condition in the ‘Stream Evolution Model’ (SEM) proposed by Cluer and Thorne (2013). In the SEM, Stage Zero is characterised by a wide range of hydromorphic attributes and ecosystem benefits, the most important of which is a fully charged hyporheic zone.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Stage Zero, an alluvial (self-formed) river and its floodplain have been undisturbed by natural or anthropogenic impacts for a period of time sufficiently long to allow the cross-sectional geometry, planform pattern and long-stream profile to adjust to the catchment (or watershed) context and the prevailing flow, sediment, and biological processes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In Stage Zero, the river characteristically comprises of a river-wetland corridor that may feature a multi-channel planform (which may be anabranching, braided or anastomosing); a single-thread, meandering channel; or a patchy-wetland without a distinct channel.
            </p>
            <p>
              The surface water component constitutes the stream and floodplain flows, which may be perennial, intermittent or ephemeral. The sub-surface component of the river (the ‘hyporheos’ – or river below) is fully-connected to the surface flows, but may or may not be connected to the regional groundwater aquifer.
            </p>
            <p>
              When studying, describing and evaluating any alluvial river (but especially one that is in its Stage Zero condition), it is important to do so in three dimensions (long-stream, lateral (accross the valley) and vertical). This is because a river is, by definition, “a system of inter-connected, surface and sub-surface flows that form a unitary whole”.

          <h2>         
             Stage Zero River Restoration
          </h2>

          <p>
            During the 1990s and 2000s, a group of US Forest Service river restoration practitioners in the Pacific Northwest came to recognise the advantages of reconnecting incised streams and rivers to their floodplains by filling in degraded channels. In response to Cluer and Thorne’s 2013 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rra.2631?                casa_token=CMa8Iel5WBcAAAAA%3AQBW2_ZLnqMWcsA2uEvLJyPFiORzzPfDBzb3C4VLIUvTvuhskZU7K3qK18E9MwUsZ-xpAFemOpkXb7ANyVA">paper</a>,
             they began referring to their projects as “Stage Zero Restoration”, and use of this ‘shorthand’ term for river-floodplain reconnection has now spread across North America and in the UK.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that Stage Zero is a river restoration outcome, rather than a specific river restoration approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Restoration to a Stage Zero condition can indeed be achieved by filling-in a degraded channel mechanically – which is sometimes termed a ‘valley floor reset’ - and/or using redundant, artificial features such as levees and embankments to fill the incised channel  – which is commonly equated to pressing ‘Ctrl-Alt-Delete’ to clear a computer problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, restoration to Stage Zero can be achieved using a raft of low-tech, process-based river restoration approaches, especially when and where beaver can be reintroduced, or allowed to naturally re-colonise a river from which they have been extirpated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stage Zero is best thought of as a destination not a journey. The path taken to restore a river to Stage Zero should be bespoke to the catchment context and anthropogenic setting of the river. In many locations restoration of a river to its pre-disturbance condition may currently be impractical due to anthropogenic constraints. But where a river can be fully reconnected to its floodplain, this may produce the greatest ecological uplift. 
          </p>

<!-- Prof. Colin Thorne attended and moderated panel discussions on ‘The uncertainties and questions regarding restoration to achieve a Stage Zero condition’ and ‘Monitoring approaches and challenges’. Breakout rooms relating to these panel discussions allowed all stakeholders to be contribute. The workshop also held talks on the practises and techniques for creating Stage Zero sites as well as the evolving state of knowledge.
            
            Stage Zero seminars led by Colin are also available in the external links.
            
            Along with the Upper Deschutes Watershed Council, Thorne has been involved in the Stage Zero restoration of Whychus creek which has created an anastomosing channel in an effort to support increased numbers of anadromous and resident fish, improve stream habitat and expanded biodiversity.[107]</p> -->
