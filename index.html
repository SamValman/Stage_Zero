                Stage Zero (0) is a period in the Stream Evolution Model, characterised by high levels of dynamism and a variety of ecosystem benefits that result from this. Increasing evidence suggests considerable river reaches had this meandering or braided stream type in the past. Therefore, increasingly Stage Zero, otherwise known as "valley floor resetting", has been seen as a river restoration condition achievable through a variety of process-based techniques, from 'light-touch' beaver dam analog and post‐assisted logjam methods, to geomorphic gradeline, valley reset methods.

                As Stage Zero projects have developed it has become vital that practitioners, scientists and stakeholders should share their perspectives and knowledge in a social learning environment. To facilitate this efforts have been made to communicate through talks and webinars such as 2020 Workshop convened by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and Institute for Natural Resources at Oregon State University. This website and the site under development aims to provide a hub to similar recommened Stage Zero resources. It has been envisioned as focal point to link interested parties involved in creating, managing and reporting of schemes with a Stage Zero target.

<!-- Prof. Colin Thorne attended and moderated panel discussions on ‘The uncertainties and questions regarding restoration to achieve a Stage Zero condition’ and ‘Monitoring approaches and challenges’. Breakout rooms relating to these panel discussions allowed all stakeholders to be contribute. The workshop also held talks on the practises and techniques for creating Stage Zero sites as well as the evolving state of knowledge.
            
            Stage Zero seminars led by Colin are also available in the external links.
            
            Along with the Upper Deschutes Watershed Council, Thorne has been involved in the Stage Zero restoration of Whychus creek which has created an anastomosing channel in an effort to support increased numbers of anadromous and resident fish, improve stream habitat and expanded biodiversity.[107]</p> -->
